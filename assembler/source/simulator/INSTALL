INSTALLING P3SIM FROM SOURCE

On Linux:

Just type "make" inside this directory. Then, copy p3SimTcl,
p3sim, and all the .gifs to a directory somewhere in you system
and edit the copyed "p3sim" file with the editor of your choice.
In the begin of the file, adjust the following lines to the
location where you installed the program:

  #!/bin/sh
  # Next line is commented for wish but uncommented for (B)ash\
  ./p3SimTcl "$0" "$@"
  # \
  exit
  set p3path "./"

For example, if you installed the emulator in /usr/local/p3sim,
edit as follows:

  #!/bin/sh
  # Next line is commented for wish but uncommented for (B)ash\
  /usr/local/p3sim/p3SimTcl "$0" "$@"
  # \
  exit
  set p3path "/usr/local/p3sim/"


On Windows:

Follow the instruction to install a MinGW32 build environment
(../INSTALL.mingw32). Then, open a MSYS shell and follow the
Linux procedure.
